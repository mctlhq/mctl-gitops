# Vault Policies

Apply after Vault is initialized and unsealed.

## Policies

### external-secrets-read
Used by the ExternalSecrets Operator (ESO) service account.
Grants read access to all platform and team secrets.

```bash
vault policy write external-secrets-read vault-policy-external-secrets-read.hcl
```

### backstage-teams-rw
Used by the Backstage VAULT_TOKEN (injected via backstage-secrets ExternalSecret).
Grants read/write access to `secret/teams/*/*` so Backstage scaffolder templates
can manage service secrets via the /proxy/vault endpoint.

```bash
vault policy write backstage-teams-rw vault-policy-backstage-teams-rw.hcl
```

Create/update the Backstage Vault token with both policies:
```bash
vault token create \
  -policy=backstage-teams-rw \
  -policy=external-secrets-read \
  -no-parent \
  -period=87600h \
  -orphan \
  -display-name=backstage

# Store the new token:
vault kv put secret/platform/backstage/vault-token token="<TOKEN>"
```

### vault-backup
Used by the `vault-backup` CronJob (namespace `vault`) to take a raft snapshot.
No long-lived token: the CronJob authenticates via Kubernetes auth using the
projected SA token of the `vault-backup` ServiceAccount.

```bash
# 1. Policy
vault policy write vault-backup vault-policy-vault-backup.hcl

# 2. Kubernetes auth role binding the vault-backup SA to the policy.
#    Short TTL is fine — the CronJob only needs the token for one snapshot.
vault write auth/kubernetes/role/vault-backup \
  bound_service_account_names=vault-backup \
  bound_service_account_namespaces=vault \
  policies=vault-backup \
  ttl=10m
```

After both commands run, the CronJob is self-sufficient and rotates auth on
every run. The legacy static token at `secret/platform/vault/backup-token`
can be deleted once the next scheduled run succeeds.
