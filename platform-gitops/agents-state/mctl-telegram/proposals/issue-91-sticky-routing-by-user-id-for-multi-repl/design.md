# Design: issue-91-sticky-routing-by-user-id-for-multi-repl

## Current state

### ClientPool

`internal/telegram/clientpool.go` declares `ClientPool` (lines 60-72):

```go
type ClientPool struct {
    APIID       int
    APIHash     string
    IdleTimeout time.Duration
    MaxSessions int
    Store       *db.Store
    metrics     *metrics.Registry
    mu          sync.Mutex
    entries     map[int64]*entry
}
```

`entries` maps an internal `user_id int64` to an `*entry`, where each entry
holds a running `*telegram.Client` goroutine pair (`run` + `gc`). The `acquire`
method creates a new entry when none exists for the user.

#### What is per-replica vs what is shared

The framing "the pool is in-process" is only half the picture, and getting the
distinction right is essential to understanding why sticky routing is needed
but a distributed pool is not.

- **Per-replica (in-process):** the `entries map[int64]*entry`, the live
  `*telegram.Client`, and its `run`/`gc` goroutines. These exist only inside the
  pod that called `acquire` and are never shared across replicas.
- **Shared (DB-backed via `Store *db.Store`):** the persisted MTProto session
  credential and its validity/last-used state. `Borrow()` consults `p.Store` on
  every invocation — `CheckSessionValid` *before* `acquire()`, `MarkLastUsed`
  after a successful call, and `RevokeActiveSession` when MTProto returns an
  auth-class error. The session credential itself is loaded/saved through
  `SessionStore{Store: p.Store}`.

The consequence: when a second replica receives a request for a user whose live
client is on replica 1, the DB still holds a valid session row, but replica 2
has no in-process entry, so `acquire` builds a fresh `*telegram.Client`. Telegram
registers that fresh connection as a **new device login**. Sticky routing
eliminates this by keeping a given `user_id` pinned to the replica that already
holds its live client. A distributed (e.g. Redis-leased) pool is therefore
**not** required to share credentials — those are already shared in the DB; the
only thing sticky routing protects is the *liveness* of one in-process client
per user, avoiding redundant device logins.

When a replica is removed or the consistent hash re-maps a user (scale event,
pod restart), the in-process client for that user is lost and the next request
on the new replica triggers exactly one "new device login". This is unavoidable
and is documented as expected behaviour, not a defect.

### Auth middleware and JWT structure

`internal/auth/middleware.go:19`: `Middleware` verifies the Bearer token via the
configured `auth.Provider`, then stores the resulting `*auth.Identity` in the
request context via `auth.With`. This runs inside the pod after the load
balancer has already selected the upstream.

`internal/auth/localjwt/issuer.go:32-42`: in `local-jwt` mode the JWT payload
carries:
- `sub` — `"tg:<telegram_id>"` (stable, human-readable)
- `tg_id` — the numeric Telegram ID as `int64`

`internal/auth/sharedhmac/verifier.go`: the `shared-hmac-legacy` path verifies
tokens signed by `api.mctl.ai`; the same `sub` format is used.

Both modes place the `sub` claim in a standard, statically located field of a
base64url-encoded JWT payload — no custom header or server-side lookup is needed
to read it.

### Config and startup

`internal/config/config.go`: no `REPLICA_ID` or `POD_NAME` field. No replica
identity is propagated into the application.

`cmd/server/main.go:48-55`: `slog.Info("starting", ...)` logs auth mode,
listen address, and telegram configuration. No replica identity.

### Metrics

`internal/metrics/metrics.go`: fourteen collectors registered on a fresh
`prometheus.Registry` (HTTP requests, auth failures, rate-limit events, tool
invocations + duration histogram, client-pool size, client errors, pool
capacity, flood-wait events, sessions connected/revoked/active, OAuth pending,
and session-borrow totals). No replica-identity gauge exists. All gauges follow
the pattern `prometheus.NewGauge(prometheus.GaugeOpts{Name: "mctl_...", Help: "..."})`.

### Documentation

`docs/hpa.md`: covers per-session memory budgets, `TELEGRAM_MAX_SESSIONS` table,
HPA stanza, Prometheus Adapter rule, and `MctlTelegramPoolNearCapacity` alert.
There is no section on sticky routing or multi-replica session safety.

A `deploy/` directory exists today with `alerts/`, `canary/`, and `grafana/`
subdirectories (added by the observability proposals #86/#87/#89). There is no
`ingress/` subdirectory yet — the Layer-1 sticky-routing manifests below are
added under a new `deploy/ingress/`.

---

## Proposed solution

The fix operates at two independent layers. Both must be active for the
multi-replica deployment to be safe.

### Layer 1: load-balancer consistent-hash routing

**Why the LB cannot verify the JWT signature**: NGINX Ingress community edition
and Envoy without the Istio JWT AuthN filter do not ship HS256 verification as
a first-class feature. Adding signature verification at the LB tier would
require distributing the `OAUTH_JWT_SIGNING_KEY` to a component outside the pod
boundary, which increases the attack surface for key exposure.

**Why omitting signature verification at the LB is acceptable**: the routing
key is used exclusively to select an upstream pod; it carries no authorization
weight. The application's auth middleware (`internal/auth/middleware.go`) is
the authoritative gate: it re-verifies the signature and rejects tampered
tokens. A client that edits its JWT payload to change the `sub` claim changes
only which pod handles the request; the forged token is rejected by the pod's
own auth check. There is no privilege escalation.

The ingress tier MUST strip the `X-Mctl-Route-Key` header from client requests
before its own extraction step so a client cannot inject a routing key without a
JWT.

**NGINX Ingress (community edition)**

Requires ingress-nginx v1.2 or later (LuaJIT enabled by default in the official
image).

```
# deploy/ingress/sticky-nginx.yaml
```

Key annotations:
- `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-hash-by: "$http_x_mctl_route_key"` —
  ketama consistent-hash on the injected header.
- `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet` — a Lua block that:
  1. Clears any client-supplied `X-Mctl-Route-Key`.
  2. Extracts the second dot-delimited segment of the `Authorization: Bearer`
     value (the JWT payload), base64url-decodes it with `ngx.decode_base64`,
     and JSON-extracts the `sub` field via `cjson.decode`.
  3. Sets `ngx.req.set_header("X-Mctl-Route-Key", sub)`.

Unauthenticated requests (no Authorization header) skip step 3; the header
stays absent and NGINX falls back to round-robin for that request, which is the
correct behaviour (the application will 401 it anyway).

**Envoy / Gateway API (Istio)**

```
# deploy/ingress/sticky-envoy.yaml
```

Two resources:
1. `EnvoyFilter` (patch type `HTTP_FILTER`) with a Lua filter that replicates
   the extraction logic above, setting `x-mctl-route-key` on the decoded `sub`.
2. `DestinationRule` with `trafficPolicy.loadBalancer.consistentHash.httpHeaderName:
   "x-mctl-route-key"`.

For Gateway API (without Istio) the equivalent is an `HTTPRoute` with a request
header modifier filter together with a `BackendLBPolicy` (GEP-1731) specifying
`consistent_hash.httpHeader: "x-mctl-route-key"`. Because `BackendLBPolicy` is
experimental in Gateway API v1.2, the Envoy example uses the Istio
`DestinationRule` which is stable and widely deployed.

### Implementation constraints (P1 traps discovered in PR #98)

A previous implementation attempt (`mctlhq/mctl-telegram#98`, closed
unmerged) shipped Ingress manifests that *parsed* and looked correct
but rendered sticky routing non-functional in both flavours. The
implementer's next attempt MUST treat these as hard constraints:

1. **NGINX `configuration-snippet` accepts NGINX directives, not raw
   Lua statements.** A snippet that contains bare `local auth = ...`
   at the top level will either be rejected by ingress-nginx or
   silently no-op. Lua must be wrapped in a directive block:
   ```nginx
   rewrite_by_lua_block {
     local auth = ngx.req.get_headers()["authorization"]
     -- ...
     ngx.req.set_header("X-Mctl-Route-Key", sub)
   }
   ```
   Reference: ingress-nginx Lua module documentation; see
   `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet` examples that
   show `*_by_lua_block` wrapping for any non-trivial logic.

2. **Envoy `HTTP_FILTER` patch requires the `Lua` filter config type,
   not `LuaPerRoute`.** `LuaPerRoute` is a per-route override message
   for an already-installed Lua filter; it does not accept
   `inline_code` and will be rejected/ignored at filter-install time.
   The EnvoyFilter patch must use:
   ```yaml
   value:
     "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.http.lua.v3.Lua
     inline_code: |
       -- function envoy_on_request(handle) ... end
   ```

3. **Envoy Lua stream-handle API does not expose
   `base64.decode`.** Only `base64Escape()` is provided. JWT payloads
   are base64url and must be decoded manually (e.g. via a bit-ops
   helper) or, preferably, the JWT `sub` should be lifted into a
   header upstream (e.g. by Istio AuthorizationPolicy /
   `jwt_payload`-claim header injection) and consumed by the Lua
   filter directly. Calling `base64.decode(...)` from `envoy_on_request`
   produces a runtime error and silently disables stickiness for every
   authenticated request.

Validation of the next attempt MUST include `kubectl apply
--dry-run=server` on both manifests and, where possible, a live smoke
of the header injection (NGINX access log showing the injected
`X-Mctl-Route-Key`, or Envoy access log via the
`%REQ(X-MCTL-ROUTE-KEY)%` format string).

### Layer 2: application — replica identity and observability

**`internal/config/config.go`** — add one field:

```go
ReplicaID string // REPLICA_ID env var; fallback to POD_NAME; fallback to "unknown"
```

Sourced as:
```go
ReplicaID: envOr("REPLICA_ID", envOr("POD_NAME", "unknown")),
```

Operators wire `POD_NAME` via the Kubernetes downward API in the Deployment
spec (`fieldPath: metadata.name`). No existing deployments are broken because
the fallback is the harmless string `"unknown"`.

**`cmd/server/main.go`** — extend the existing `slog.Info("starting", ...)` call
to include `"replica_id", cfg.ReplicaID`. After the metrics registry is
constructed and the pool-capacity gauge is set, add:

```go
m.TelegramReplicaID.WithLabelValues(cfg.ReplicaID).Set(1)
slog.Info("replica identity", "replica_id", cfg.ReplicaID)
```

**`internal/metrics/metrics.go`** — add to `Registry`:

```go
// TelegramReplicaID is an info-type gauge (constant value 1) labeled by
// replica_id. Operators use it to verify that a given user_id consistently
// hits the same replica by cross-referencing with pod-scoped pool metrics.
TelegramReplicaID *prometheus.GaugeVec
```

Constructed in `New()`:

```go
r.TelegramReplicaID = prometheus.NewGaugeVec(prometheus.GaugeOpts{
    Name: "mctl_telegram_replica_id",
    Help: "Info gauge (always 1) identifying this replica. " +
        "Label replica_id is sourced from REPLICA_ID / POD_NAME env vars.",
}, []string{"replica_id"})
```

Registered alongside the existing collectors in `reg.MustRegister(...)`.

The gauge is NOT set inside `New()` itself because the `replica_id` label value
comes from config, which is not available to `metrics.New()`. The caller
(`cmd/server/main.go`) sets it after config load.

**`docs/hpa.md`** — extend with a new section "Sticky routing for multi-replica
deployments" covering:
- The in-process pool problem and the "New login" UX impact.
- The two-layer solution summary.
- Security analysis (why payload-only extraction without sig verification is
  acceptable at the routing tier).
- Downward API snippet for `POD_NAME`.
- How to verify: `kubectl exec` into a pod, `curl /metrics`, and check
  `mctl_telegram_replica_id{replica_id="..."}`.
- One-time "New login" notifications on pod restarts/re-hashes and why this
  is unavoidable.
- Reference to the `deploy/ingress/` examples.

## Alternatives

### Alternative 1: Kubernetes Service `sessionAffinity: ClientIP`

Kubernetes Services support `sessionAffinity: ClientIP` with a configurable
timeout. This provides IP-level stickiness without any ingress change.

**Rejected** because MCP clients frequently share a single egress IP (corporate
NAT, shared gateway). Multiple users behind the same NAT would all hash to the
same pod, producing a severe load imbalance. Stickiness must be at user_id
granularity, not IP granularity.

### Alternative 2: Redis-backed distributed ClientPool

Replace the in-process `entries map[int64]*entry` with a distributed lease
backed by Redis (or equivalent). Each `Borrow()` acquires a lease for
`user_id`; the lease directs the request to whichever pod holds the MTProto
connection. If the pod dies, the lease expires and another pod re-creates the
session.

**Rejected for this issue** because:
- The issue explicitly marks this out of scope.
- It adds a stateful dependency (Redis) and increases `Borrow()` latency with
  a network round-trip on every tool invocation.
- It does not eliminate "New login" notifications on pod failures; it only
  reduces their frequency.
- Sticky routing at the LB achieves the same zero-extra-session goal with no
  new infrastructure dependency.

### Alternative 3: Cap replicas to 1 via Deployment maxReplicas

Set `maxReplicas: 1` in the HPA spec to prevent multi-replica operation until a
full distributed-pool solution is ready.

**Rejected** because it blocks the Beta readiness goal described in the issue
and makes the HPA configuration in `docs/hpa.md` non-functional for its stated
purpose.

## Platform impact

### Migrations

None. The `ReplicaID` field has safe defaults; the gauge is additive; no schema
changes are required.

### Backward compatibility

- Existing single-replica deployments continue to work unchanged. The new
  `mctl_telegram_replica_id{replica_id="unknown"}` gauge appears in metrics but
  breaks no existing dashboards or alert rules.
- The Ingress examples are opt-in; they are not applied automatically by any
  CI step in this repository.

### Resource impact

- One additional Prometheus time-series per replica (negligible).
- The Lua extraction snippet adds sub-millisecond overhead per request at the
  ingress tier (one base64 decode + one JSON parse of a small payload).

### Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| ingress-nginx upgrade changes Lua API surface | Low | Pin ingress-nginx version in the example manifest; document in the sticky routing section of `docs/hpa.md` |
| Consistent-hash rebalancing on pod add/remove causes one-time "New login" per re-mapped user | Low-Medium | Document in ops runbook; accept as unavoidable; alert on `mctl_telegram_client_errors_total` spike after scale events |
| Client forges `X-Mctl-Route-Key` before Lua extraction (if header strip is misconfigured) | Low | Routes to an arbitrary pod; rejected by app-level auth; no privilege escalation. The soak test should assert header stripping works |
| `POD_NAME` not injected via downward API | Low | Fallback to `"unknown"` keeps startup working; monitoring alert on `replica_id="unknown"` can catch missing configuration |
